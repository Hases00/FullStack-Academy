      Infinity if one of the numbers is Infinity and the other is not So if we
      apply this reasoning to the multiply function, we can expect: <br />
      <br />Expect multiply(x, y) to return the product of x and y <br />Expect
      multiply(x, 1) to return x <br />Expect multiply(1, y) to return y
      <br />Expect multiply(x, y) to be commutative, meaning multiply(x, y)
      should be the same as multiply(y, x) <br />Expect multiply(x, y) to be
      associative, meaning multiply(x, multiply(y, z)) should be the same as
      multiply(multiply(x, y), z) <br />Expect multiply(x,y) to be distributive
      over multiplication, meaning multiply(x, multiply(y, z)) should be the
      same as multiply(multiply(x, y), multiply(x, z)) <br />Expect multiply(x,
      y) to return NaN if either x or y is not a number <br />Expect multiply(x,
      y) to return Infinity if one of the numbers is Infinity and the other is
      not <br />Expect multiply(x, y) to return 0 if either x or y is 0

      the multiply function based on its --!
